# 2026-02-27

- User requested: "Refais ta demande".
- Action executed: resubmitted CTO deep-dive request in a fresh dedicated session (`cto-mcit-deepdive-r3`) with compact anti-echo prompt and single consolidated audit file.
- Policy maintained: no second message to CTO until response to this request.
- r3 result: failed on macOS accessibility permission (`Accessibility permission denied`), no analyzable CTO output returned.
- On renewed user request, launched r4 in a fresh CTO session with compact anti-echo prompt + single consolidated report; waiting for response (no extra message until reply).
- r4 response received but mostly echoed prompt + injected report content (`FILE_CONTEXT`); no substantial new deep-dive arbitration beyond existing v2 conclusions.
